# Nate McCord's Dotfiles

Installation is as easy as
`./install`
inside the main folder

But if you like what you see you should really fork it instead! Making your own dotfiles is fun, exciting and teaches you a lot. It let's you make your computer feel like **you**.

### Current functionality

* Install homebrew, zsh, oh-my-zsh
* Install lots of apps with brew and cask
* Update vimrc and install vundle plugins
